# OSA ‚Äî Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection

A deep learning project aimed at **automatically classifying the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)** using PSG (Polysomnography) signals and cephalometric data.

---

## üß† About

This project leverages **time-domain and frequency-domain features** extracted from PSG signals, combined with clinical data, to train deep learning models that classify OSA severity. The goal is to provide a reliable and automated diagnostic aid for clinicians.

## üîß Features Extracted

- **MFCC, Delta MFCC** ‚Äì Capture spectral patterns and their temporal changes from PSG signals.  
- **ZCR (Zero-Crossing Rate)** ‚Äì Measures frequency variations and signal noisiness.  
- **Other Features** ‚Äì Time-domain (mean, variance) and frequency-domain (spectral centroid, bandwidth) to summarize signal characteristics for OSA severity classification.
